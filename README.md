# Dnd5eJsonHost
This is used to store JSON for my personal use.
I own nothing, all credit goes to BTMorton for creating these JSON. 
I simply am keeping a copy of his files in case they ever get deleted for my personal project.

Go there instead to the original project if you somehow stumbled here: https://github.com/BTMorton/dnd-5e-srd
